# Gender Reveal Challenge
Your goal is to make the tests pass in order to reveal the secret!

## Requirements

You need Node.JS installed for this challenge.

## Setup

Setting up this project is very simple:

```
git clone https://github.com/seanspradlin/gender-reveal-challenge.git
cd gender-reveal-challenge
npm install
```

## Run Test

Run the unit test and then fix the code in the lib folder until all tests are
passing.

To run the tests, run;

```
npm test
```

## Reveal

Once the tests all pass, run:

```
npm start
```

## Notes

Complete the coding challenges in the `lib/interpolate-names.js` and `lib/milestone.js` files in order to make the tests pass (and the reveal work).
